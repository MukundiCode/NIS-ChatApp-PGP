open pgpFinalMethods ib terminal
javac *.java
java PGPmessages.java
This runs a simple send and receive of messages

What I did
Jonos RSA class was used for public/private key gen
Encryption class was changed to use bytes
I wrote some of my own encryption methods, I saw i basically rewrote one of the origal methods so i just took it out
Dropped main
Hashing class is dropped

RSA class was untouched

For logging I left a bunch of comments to help the logging process. Just dont log the compression parts

I can help incoporate the pgp in the chat. I only included the files that I changed in this branch.
